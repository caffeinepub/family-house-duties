  "summary": "REQ-3 appears largely implemented: 3 color scheme suggestions are provided (with one selected) and the default palette is applied by updating CSS variable theme tokens in frontend/src/index.css for both light (:root) and dark (.dark), including primary/secondary/accent/muted/background/foreground/border/ring/destructive/success plus chart/sidebar tokens. Some additional, unrequested project/meta changes and a radius adjustment were also included.",
