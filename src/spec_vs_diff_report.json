  "summary": "Diff adds task edit/delete handlers and identity lookup in CalendarDayPlanner/CalendarWeekPlanner, and enhances RecurringChoresDialog to support opening to a specific chore ID. However, recurring chore deletion from calendar views does not appear to call the existing deleteRecurringChore mutation directly after confirmation (it opens the dialog instead), and due to truncation there isn’t clear evidence that the per-item Edit/Delete controls are actually rendered in the day/week task & chore lists with creator-only gating.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Recurring chore Delete from CalendarDayPlanner/CalendarWeekPlanner must prompt for confirmation and, on confirmation, call the existing deleteRecurringChore mutation (with React Query invalidation/refresh).",
      "reason": "In both planners, `handleDeleteChore` confirms but then only sets `editingChoreId` and opens `RecurringChoresDialog` rather than invoking a delete mutation. In CalendarDayPlanner it even attempts a dynamic import of `useDeleteRecurringChore` and comments that hooks must be used at component level, indicating deletion is not performed here.",
