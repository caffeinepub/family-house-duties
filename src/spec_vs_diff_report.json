  "summary": "The diff does not implement the requested hero/header image swaps or add the required static image assets; it only updates project_state.json metadata and references unrelated backend readiness issues.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Replace the existing hero/header images used at the top of each main tab with more visually appealing, clean, modern-day images while keeping the same image filenames and dimensions currently referenced by the UI.",
      "reason": "No frontend UI files or image assets were modified/added; only project_state.json was changed, so the hero/header images cannot be updated in the UI.",
      "evidence": [
        "project_state.json"

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Add the updated hero/header image files as static assets under frontend/public/assets/generated, matching the exact filenames referenced by the HeroHeader usage in each tab.",
      "reason": "No files were added under frontend/public/assets/generated (no added files at all), so the required header image assets are not present.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly states the backend must remain unchanged and that fixing the 'backup backend is not ready' / add-task readiness issue is a non-goal, yet project metadata emphasizes this backend issue.",
