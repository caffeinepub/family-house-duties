  "summary": "Frontend changes add structured diagnostics utilities and update RecurringChores dialog/query hooks for better mutation logging and error normalization. No backend (Motoko) changes are present in the provided diff summary, so upgrade persistence and backend-side diagnostics cannot be verified as implemented.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Add backend persistence for recurring chores across canister upgrades by storing recurring chores and the recurring chore ID counter in stable state using preupgrade/postupgrade hooks (Motoko).",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows only frontend file additions/modifications; there is no evidence of any backend/main.mo changes or new backend/migration.mo implementing stable storage and upgrade hooks.",

        "<file-diff> summary shows Added/Modified files all under frontend/src; no backend files listed"

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Add structured console logging on the backend around create/update/pause/delete (including backend traps) so failures can be pinpointed quickly.",
      "reason": "Frontend structured logging was added, but there is no evidence of any backend logging/trap instrumentation because no backend files were modified in the diff summary.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the Recurring Chores dialog Save button always submits the correct form, remains enabled only when inputs are valid, and shows a clear pending state (\"Saving...\") while the mutation is in-flight; clicking fires exactly once; after success form resets and list updates.",
      "reason": "RecurringChoresDialog.tsx is truncated; the diff summary mentions double-submission prevention and inline validation in a separate file-summary text, but the provided code excerpt does not show the Save button wiring, pending state label \"Saving...\", or the single-fire submit behavior. This cannot be confirmed from the diff evidence provided.",
