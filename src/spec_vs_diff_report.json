  "summary": "Implemented a user-selectable theme mode control (Light/Dark/System) in the authenticated Header dropdown, added app-wide theming via next-themes ThemeProvider with a persistent storageKey, and wrapped both authenticated and unauthenticated (login/loading) views so the stored theme applies across sessions. Major-screen dark-mode token compliance is suggested by file summaries but cannot be fully verified from the truncated diffs.",
