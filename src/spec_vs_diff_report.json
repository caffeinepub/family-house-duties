However, the required static hero image assets and exact required filenames/paths are not evidenced in the diff, and at least one hero image reference (CalendarView) appears truncated/possibly incorrect. An additional non-requested generated image is referenced in TaskList.",

      "reason": "CalendarView’s HeroHeader imageSrc is shown as a truncated/possibly invalid path (ends with \".jp\" in the truncated snippet), so it is not verifiable that the Calendar hero renders successfully. DinnerRota’s actual HeroHeader placement is not visible in the truncated diff content, so it cannot be confirmed.",

      "reason": "The diff summary shows no added files under frontend/public/assets/generated, so the presence of the required hero image files cannot be confirmed. Additionally, the referenced hero filenames in code use a different naming pattern (e.g., header-*.dim_1600x420.jpg) than the BuildRequest-required names (hero-*.dim_1600x400.jpg).",
